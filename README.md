### Tests for rANS with fixed accuracy

This is a test implementation of the rANS (range ANS) entropy encoder with fixed accuracy from the paper "Efficiency of ANS Entropy Encoders" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02514). 
It is compared against the standard rANS (rans.cpp) and the rANS with fast divisions performed through multiplication and shifts on precomputed constants (rans-fast.cpp).
These two ANS variants are retrieved from Fabian Giesen's ryg_rans implementation: https://github.com/rygorous/ryg_rans

The encoders are tested on sequences of length 64K with byte alphabets (0-255) generated by geometric distribution (p=0.7, p=0.3) and uniform distribution.
The results show that the encoding of the rANS with accuracy 3 is faster than the standard rANS but slower than the optimized variant (rans-fast). 
This suggests that the rANS with accuracy 3 might be used as an adaptive rANS (when it is impossible to precompute constants for fast divisions).
However, the rANS with accuracy 3 has slower decoding, so, it makes sense to apply it only if the fast encoding is the primary goal.
